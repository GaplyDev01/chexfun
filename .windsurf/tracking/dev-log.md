# Development Log

## 2025-04-25
- Focus: Initial implementation of core chessboard gameplay (ChessGameBoard component)
- Context: Created `src/app/chessboard.tsx` for main chessboard UI using chess.js and react-chessboard. No multiplayer or lobby yet. File tree updated.
- Multiplayer setup started: Added `src/app/socket.ts` as socket.io client singleton for multiplayer logic.
- Supabase project `chexfun-db` created ($10/mo, real-time, healthy). Tables: `games`, `moves` for persistent and real-time chess state.
- Next Steps: Integrate multiplayer logic (socket.io), add time control, build lobby/invite flow, polish UI for streamer mode.
- Task ID: T001 (core gameplay)
