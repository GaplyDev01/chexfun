# Development Log

## 2025-04-28
- Focus: Edge-case handling (timeouts, forfeits, disputes), accessibility/mobile polish, manual test prep
- Context: Chessboard now blocks moves after non-active status, user feedback banners, ARIA/focus/mobile improvements
- Decisions: All status changes are visible, accessibility is WCAG-compliant for main flows
- Next Steps: Complete manual test of all flows, update documentation and tracking files, review compliance
- Task IDs: T004, T005, T006, T007


## 2025-04-25
- Focus: Initial implementation of core chessboard gameplay (ChessGameBoard component)
- Context: Created `src/app/chessboard.tsx` for main chessboard UI using chess.js and react-chessboard. No multiplayer or lobby yet. File tree updated.
- Multiplayer setup started: Added `src/app/socket.ts` as socket.io client singleton for multiplayer logic.
- Supabase project `chexfun-db` created ($10/mo, real-time, healthy). Tables: `games`, `moves` for persistent and real-time chess state.
- Next Steps: Integrate multiplayer logic (socket.io), add time control, build lobby/invite flow, polish UI for streamer mode.
- Task ID: T001 (core gameplay)
